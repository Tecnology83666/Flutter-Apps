# Travel Routes App with Flutter, Google Maps, Riverpod and flutter_animate
The app leverages Google Maps Platform, creating a robust travel tool. It integrates with Google Maps, displaying user-specific locations and routes and providing real-time geolocation services via the 'geolocator' package. Geocoding API translates coordinates into user-friendly addresses. Detailed location information, including photos and operating hours, is accessible thanks to Places API integration. Users can get routes and directions with Routes API. 

The app utilizes Riverpod for state management. State is stored and updated through providers and notifiers. Additionally, the 'flutter_animate' library enhances the UI with engaging animations, enriching navigation throughout the app.
